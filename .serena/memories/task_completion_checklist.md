# Task Completion Checklist

When completing any development task in this project, follow these steps:

## Code Quality Checks
1. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to check for code style issues
2. **Type Checking**: Ensure TypeScript compilation passes (no type errors)
3. **Build Verification**: Run `npm run build` to ensure production build succeeds

## Testing and Validation
- **Manual Testing**: Test functionality in development server (`npm run dev`)
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Verify functionality works in different browsers
- **Responsive Testing**: Check mobile and desktop layouts
- **Error Handling**: Verify error states and edge cases

## Environment and Dependencies
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are documented
- **Dependencies**: Verify no unused dependencies are added
- **Security**: Check that no secrets or keys are committed to repository

## Documentation
- Update code comments for complex logic (though minimal commenting is preferred)
- Update type definitions if database schema changes
- Ensure component interfaces are properly typed

## Database Considerations
- Test database operations in both development and production environments
- Verify data integrity and proper error handling
- Check that database migrations (if any) are properly applied

## Deployment Readiness
- Verify build process completes without errors
- Test that environment variables are properly configured for production
- Ensure Netlify redirects work correctly for SPA routing
- Check that static assets are properly bundled

## Final Checks
- Git status clean (no uncommitted sensitive files)
- All console.error statements provide meaningful information
- Performance considerations (especially for data fetching operations)
- Accessibility considerations for UI changes
